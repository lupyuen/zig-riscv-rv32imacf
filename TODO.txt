* Add abstraction for PRCI
* Rewrite src/clock.c in Zig
* Make LED handler read payload to determine desired LED status
* Allow setting all three LEDs
	* Will likely require some sort of subdispatcher code in zoap
	* That is, a subdispatcher for /led
* Debug occasional "bad checksum" Slipmux errors
* Buffer incoming UART data in a linear FIFO
	* To reduce time spend in interrupt handler
* Use RISC-V atomic instructions for MMIO
	* For example, atomic_or etc. (see RIOT code)
	* To-Do: Figure out how Zig abstracts these instructions
